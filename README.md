# task-allocation-strategy
This GitHub repository contains the Python source code that implements a novel task-allocation strategy inspired by response-threshold methods which deals with tasks with time deadlines in such a way that each robot makes the decision about the best task to perform through an optimization problem, which is solved according to the celebrate technique to optimize in a fuzzy environment due to R.E. Bellman and L.A. Zadeh.
